# Scooter

Modern terminals support
[**HYPER**links](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/glossary/#term-hyperlinks).
Unfortunately, not all tools have support for the format.

`Scooter` uses regex to find links and replaces them with the **HYPER**link version.

> Currently, only `python` and `mypy` formats are supported.
